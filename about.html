							<h1>My Journey with Technical Communication</h1>
							<p>I‚Äôve wanted to be a technical editor ever since I became fascinated with the English language; I just didn‚Äôt have a word for it at the time.<br><br>

							In November 2019 (my senior year of high school), I was a copy editor intern at Denver Westword Magazine, where I worked with a team of editors and publishers to prepare Westword‚Äôs ‚ÄúWinter Guide‚Äù for publication. While I enjoyed editing in a professional setting, I realized that I loved editing technical and scientific content more than editing in a journalism context. When I shared my thoughts with the managing editor I was working with, she introduced me to the field of technical communication. Since then, I‚Äôve had a clear goal to target my academic efforts towards.<br>
							<br>
							I've earned A's in the five TECM courses I've taken so far at UNT, and I'm excited to learn more. Through these classes, I've crafted several portfolio pieces which you will find in the Writing & Editing, Research, and Design sections of my portfolio.<br>
							<br>
							If you're looking for a technical writer or technical editor intern to join your team, I am not only willing but also grateful to learn about the opportunity. I hope to hear from you soon!

							<h1>My Journey with Content Creation</h1>
							<p>All my life, my print handwriting has been described with a plethora of adjectives from "pretty" to "perfect." I begain learning calligraphy when the world shut down in March 2020 and received many compliments on my work. In December of that same year, I thought it would be fun to dedicate a TikTok account to my handwriting and handlettering. Little did I know: This would become my business.<br><br>

							TikTok is a fascinating platform in that it's possible no one may see your video, or millions of people could view within a few hours. One day, I had 200 followers; the next morning, I had 22,700. From that moment, I began catering my content towards my audience's requests and needs. More importantly, over time, I've observed patterns that have helped me understand the TikTok algorithm. As a result, several of my videos have "gone viral," including a few of my sponsored posts. I received my first request for a brand collaboration in February 2020, and since then, I've worked with Pentel, Speechify, Fonts App, Gauthmath, StudySmarter, and more. My sponsored video for StudySmarter (seen to the right) currently has over 3.7 million views and 285,000 likes.<br><br>

							If you are a brand looking for someone with a platform on TikTok to take part in your campaign, or if you are a fellow content creator hoping to collaborate, I would love to hear from you! All of my work in the Digital Marketing section of my portfolio is exemplary of ads, collaborations, and promotions I've created and posted on my TikTok account. I hope to hear from you soon! </p>
